#  User Stories — Airbnb Clone System

This document outlines the user stories for the Airbnb Clone backend system. Each story describes how different roles interact with the system to achieve specific goals. These stories are derived from the use case diagram and serve as a foundation for feature development, testing, and validation.



##  Purpose

User stories help define:
- Functional expectations from the system
- Role-based interactions (User, Host, Admin)
- Real-world scenarios that guide backend logic and API design
